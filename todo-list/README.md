## ✅ TodoList - A React Task Management App
This project was created as a way to **better understand React** and practice **React Hooks** in a real application.  
It focuses on state management, component communication, and building reusable UI while experimenting with Tailwind CSS.

TodoList is a simple yet powerful task management application built with React and Tailwind CSS.  
It allows users to create, manage, and track tasks with a clean interface — optimized for daily productivity.

## ⚛️ React Hooks Used
- **useState** → To manage todo list state and form input values.  
- **useRef** → To maintain unique incremental IDs without causing re-renders.  
- **Props (child → parent communication)** → For passing event handlers and state updates between components.

## 🚀 Features
- **Add New Todos**  
  Users can add tasks with a title and content through a simple form.
- **Mark as Done / Keep Going**  
  Toggle tasks between *Done* and *KeepGoing* states for clear progress tracking.
- **Delete Todos**  
  Remove completed or unnecessary tasks with one click.
- **Custom Styling**  
  Includes subtle background patterns, animated emoji in the header, and custom fonts for a fun UI.
- **ID System with nanoid**  
  Each todo is uniquely identified using the `nanoid` library.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How to manage state across parent and child components using React `useState` and props.  
- Applied `useRef` to handle incremental IDs without unnecessary re-renders.  
- Practiced structuring React apps with reusable components (`Layout`, `Header`, `TodoForm`, `List`, `Todo`).  
- Learned to replace plain CSS with **Tailwind utility classes** while still integrating CSS variables.  
- Improved UI/UX by adding animations, responsive design, and a global background style.

## ✨ Personal Note
This TodoList project represents my step-by-step growth in React and Tailwind CSS.  
I focused not only on functionality but also on design details such as custom fonts, background patterns, and interactive animations.  
For me, this project is a foundation for building larger and more complex applications.
