# 🔍 react-deep-dive

`react-deep-dive` is a **personal study repository** dedicated to exploring React in depth.  
The focus is on **React Hooks** — building small, self-contained projects that each demonstrate practical usage of hooks in real scenarios.  
By creating and experimenting with these projects, I aim to move beyond theory and gain a deeper, hands-on understanding of React.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
- To strengthen my understanding of **React fundamentals**.  
- To practice **React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useContext`, `useReducer`, etc.)** through dedicated mini-projects.  
- To build a collection of **hands-on examples** that can serve as a personal reference for future projects.  
- To dive deeper into **component composition, state management, and side effects** with real use cases.

## 🧠 What I Expect to Learn
- How to apply each **React Hook** in real contexts.  
- The differences between hooks and when to choose the right one.  
- Best practices for **React Hooks** in small to medium projects.  
- How to structure reusable components while keeping code clean and maintainable.  
- Confidence in moving from “tutorial knowledge” to **practical, deep understanding** of React.
